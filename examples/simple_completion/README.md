# Simple Completion Example

This example demonstrates how to use the gopenrouter library to make simple text completion requests with comprehensive usage reporting and credits monitoring.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Simple Text Completion**: Basic completion request with prompt
- **Usage Reporting**: Enable usage statistics in the response
- **Generation Details**: Retrieve detailed metadata about the completion
- **Credits Monitoring**: Check account credits before and after requests
- **Provider Options**: Advanced routing with provider preferences
- **Cost Calculation**: Track the cost of individual requests

## Prerequisites

1. Go 1.19 or later
2. OpenRouter API key

## Setup

1. Set your OpenRouter API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

## Running the Example

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Example Output

## Key Components

### 1. Usage Reporting
```go
request := gopenrouter.NewCompletionRequestBuilder(model, prompt).
    WithUsage(true).
    Build()
```

### 2. Generation Details
```go
// Make the completion request
response, err := client.Completion(ctx, request)

// Get detailed generation information using the response ID
generationData, err := client.GetGeneration(ctx, response.ID)
```

### 3. Credits Monitoring
```go
// Check credits before the request
initialCredits, err := client.GetCredits(ctx)

// Make completion request...

// Check credits after the request
finalCredits, err := client.GetCredits(ctx)

// Calculate request cost
requestCost := finalCredits.TotalUsage - initialCredits.TotalUsage
```

### 4. Provider Options
```go
providerOptions := gopenrouter.NewProviderOptionsBuilder().
    WithAllowFallbacks(true).
    WithMaxPromptPrice(0.001).
    WithMaxCompletionPrice(0.002).
    Build()
```

## Understanding the Output

- **Credits Status**: Shows total credits purchased, total usage, and remaining balance
- **Token Usage**: Breakdown of prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total
- **Generation Details**: Comprehensive metadata including costs, latency, and provider information
- **Cost Tracking**: Calculates the cost of individual requests by comparing before/after credits
